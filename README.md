SESSION/LAB 1
=============

This week we will start working with OpenGL, using these resources :
1.1 Introduction to Computer Graphics
1.2 Introduction to OpenGL
Lab Guide
lab1.zip

And following these objectives :

    -Key principles of OpenGL
    -How to work with JOLG
    -How to code with Groovy
    -How to build / execute a Gradle project

Indeed, this first session is just an introduction, in order to take a first look of foundations that we will need in the first part of this course.

    NOTES:
        To run the project from terminal just do:
        gradle compileGroovy
        gradle run


SESSION/LAB 2
=============

This second week we will study the first topic of SciVis, starting with the data volumes :

2.1 Data Volumes (slides 1-29)
Lab Guide (updated)
lab2.zip

The objectives of this session are :

    -Understand the basics of SciVis
    -Understand the voxel concept
    -First contact with Groovy/JOGL
    -Generate a voxel volume

In addition, in this session we will introduce the first lab exercise, that can be done during the one hour of class.


SESSION/LAB 3
=============

This third week we will continue the first topic of SciVis, the data volumes :

2.1 Data Volumes (slides 30-59)
Lab Guide (updated)
lab3.zip

The objectives of this session are :

    -How to load voxel data
    ?-Study optimization structures
    -Learn the Histogram concept
    ?-Understand the Transfer function


SESSION/LAB 4
=============

Dear Students,

This week we will start the second topic of SciVis, the calculated data :

2.2 Calculated Data
Lab Guide (updated)
lab4.zip

The objectives of this session are :

Understand the Surface Extraction concept
Learn the main algorithms : 
    marching squares
    marching cubes
    dividing cubes

In addition, in this session we will introduce the first practise of the course. 
This task includes the documentation and the skeletor project.
